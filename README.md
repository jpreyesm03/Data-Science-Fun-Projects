# Goalscoring Trends in Europe's Top 5 Football Leagues by Nationality and Applied Statistical Tests

This project explores **goalscoring trends in Europe's Top 5 Football Leagues**, analyzing the impact of players' nationalities. By combining data science techniques with football analytics, I uncovered fascinating insights through **data parsing, visualization, and statistical analysis**.

## üîç **Project Overview**  
- **Goal**: Understand historical goalscoring patterns grouped by nationality in Europe‚Äôs top football leagues.  
- **Leagues Covered**:  
  - Premier League  
  - La Liga  
  - Serie A  
  - Bundesliga  
  - Ligue 1  

Through this journey, I explored questions like:  
- How have players from different nations contributed to these leagues?  
- Which nation could dominate goalscoring in the coming years?

## üìä **Methodology**  

### 1. **Historical Foundations**  
I started by researching the leagues' origins. Did you know that the **Bundesliga**, launched in 1963, is the most recent of the Top 5 leagues?  

### 2. **Data Collection**  
Using the [WorldFootball.net Goalscorer Dataset](https://www.worldfootball.net/goalgetter/), I parsed data from over **60 seasons**. By optimizing runtime and using efficient algorithms, I processed thousands of data points into a structured format, saved as an Excel file.

### 3. **Data Visualization**  
I uploaded the processed data to [Flourish Studio](https://app.flourish.studio/) to create an engaging **race visualization**. It shows the top 20 goal-scoring nations, color-coded by continent, over time. [Check out the video with the result!](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19804828/)
üí° **Insight**: Germany currently leads, but how long can they hold their crown?

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**  
In the notebook **"Statistical Analysis Top 5 Leagues.ipynb"**, I:  
- Used **probabilistic modeling** to predict trends.  
- Found that **France has a 64.8% chance** of overtaking Germany as the top goal-scoring nation within the next 10 years.  
- Projected, with 95% confidence, that France will surpass Germany by **2039**.

To ensure robustness:  
- Performed the **Shapiro-Wilk Test** for normality.  
- Ran **Levene‚Äôs Test** to validate equal variances.

## üß† **Lessons Learned**  
1. **Data is only as valuable as its source**: Using credible datasets ensured the validity of my results.  
2. **Statistics ‚â† Certainty**: Despite the confidence intervals, football‚Äôs unpredictable nature remains an essential factor.  
3. **Human Insight**: Data alone isn‚Äôt enough; understanding context is critical for meaningful analysis.

## ‚öΩ **Key Takeaways**  
- France's recent dominance in goal-scoring highlights the rise of their domestic and international players.  
- Goal trends fluctuate across decades, influenced by generational talents, coaching styles, and league dynamics.
